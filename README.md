The Covid19 pandemic has taken a heavy toll on industries around the world, of these, one of the most affected ones is hospitality, influenced by international lockdowns and economic downturn. This project looks to utilise R along with its data handling and visualisation packages to look at data sourced from AirBnb which ranks amongst the most popular booking apps in the world, catering strongly towards smaller businesses as opposed to major hotels. This allows for a more representative view of the hospitality industry by looking at those most affected.
