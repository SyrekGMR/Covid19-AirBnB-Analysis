The global hospitality industry acts as a useful indicator for the global economy, in times of great prosperity the global tourism industry booms, boosting local hospitality businesses, conversely economic downturn often leads to frugality and uncertainty which can see a sharp decrease in international tourism. <br>
<br><br>
2020 has proven to be a challenging year, with the Covid19 pandemic taking a heavy toll on the global economy. This project looks towards data sourced from Airbnb to analyse the impacts of the pandemic on the hospitality industry of major tourist hubs around the world, hoping to learn just how dire the situation truly is.
